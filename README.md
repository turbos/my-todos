##Instructions##
To demonstrate your skills you will need to build a simple web application with the following features.:

***User Story #1***

- As a user, I want to be able to enter my tasks, due dates and priorities so that I can
view them at a later date.

***User Story #2***

- As a user, I want to be able to view all of my tasks entered previously and mark those that have been completed.

***User Story #3***

- As a user, I want to be able to sort the tasks by due date, description, and priority in
the UI so that I can better organise my tasks.

***User Story #4***

- As a user, I want to be alerted to any tasks due today so I can perform them now.

##Assessments##
Your code should be:
- production-ready
- understandable and maintainable by other developers
- robust and handle exceptions
- bug free
